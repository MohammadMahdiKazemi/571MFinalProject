# TimeSformer

This is an official pytorch implementation of our Project (A Transformer-based video analysis framework for
Estimating Ejection Fraction from Echocardiograms) for  571F course.

# Loading the Model


You can load the pretrained models as follows:

```python
import torch
from timesformer.models.vit import TimeSformer

model = TimeSformer(img_size=224, num_classes=400, num_frames=8, attention_type='divided_space_time',  pretrained_model='/path/to/pretrained/model.pyth')

dummy_video = torch.randn(2, 3, 8, 224, 224) # (batch x channels x frames x height x width)

pred = model(dummy_video,) # (2, 400)
```

# Installation

First, create a conda virtual environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n timesformer python=3.7 -y
source activate timesformer
```

Then, install the following packages:

- torchvision: `pip install torchvision` or `conda install torchvision -c pytorch`
- [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/): `pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore'`
- simplejson: `pip install simplejson`
- einops: `pip install einops`
- timm: `pip install timm`
- PyAV: `conda install av -c conda-forge`
- psutil: `pip install psutil`
- scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- tensorboard: `pip install tensorboard`

Lastly, build the TimeSformer codebase by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer
cd TimeSformer
python setup.py build develop
```

# Usage

## Training the Default TimeSformer

Training the default TimeSformer that uses divided space-time attention, and operates on 8-frame clips cropped at 224x224 spatial resolution, can be done using the following command:

```
python tools/run_net.py \
  --cfg configs/Kinetics/TimeSformer_divST_8x32_224.yaml \
  DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset \
  NUM_GPUS 8 \
  TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE 8 \
```
You may need to pass location of your dataset in the command line by adding `DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset`, or you can simply add

```
DATA:
  PATH_TO_DATA_DIR: path_to_your_dataset
```

To the yaml configs file, then you do not need to pass it to the command line every time.

## Using a Different Number of GPUs

If you want to use a smaller number of GPUs, you need to modify .yaml configuration files in [`configs/`](configs/). Specifically, you need to modify the NUM_GPUS, TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE, TEST.BATCH_SIZE, DATA_LOADER.NUM_WORKERS entries in each configuration file. The BATCH_SIZE entry should be the same or higher as the NUM_GPUS entry. In [`configs/Kinetics/TimeSformer_divST_8x32_224_4gpus.yaml`](configs/Kinetics/TimeSformer_divST_8x32_224_4gpus.yaml), we provide a sample configuration file for a 4 GPU setup.


## Inference

Use `TRAIN.ENABLE` and `TEST.ENABLE` to control whether training or testing is required for a given run. When testing, you also have to provide the path to the checkpoint model via TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH.
```
python tools/run_net.py \
  --cfg configs/Kinetics/TimeSformer_divST_8x32_224_TEST.yaml \
  DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset \
  TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH path_to_your_checkpoint \
  TRAIN.ENABLE False \
```
